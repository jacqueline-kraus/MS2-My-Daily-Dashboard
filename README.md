## User stories
### As a business owner:
- I want to give information and recommendation on a daily basis in form of a dashboard to have everything in one place
- I want to provide a clear, easy understandable dashboard with the option to refresh the items

### As a user:
- I want to be in a good mood by laughing about a joke
- I want to know the daily weather forecast
- If I change my location, I still want to know the daily weather forecast, but for the new location
- I want to have a recommendation on which movie I could watch
- I want to have a recommendation on what I could cook and eat
- If I don't like any of the recommendations given, I want to have a new recommendation
- I want all of this in one place without needing to open 4 different apps


BUGS:
<div class="row">
                <div class="text-center page-headline">
                    <h1>My Daily Dashboard</h1>
                </div>
            </div>
---> workaround to get headline centered (not possible with flexbox)
